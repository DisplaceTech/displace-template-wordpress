# Custom WordPress Themes
#
# Place your custom themes in this directory.
# Each theme should be in its own subdirectory.
#
# Example structure:
#   themes/
#   ├── my-theme/
#   │   ├── style.css
#   │   ├── functions.php
#   │   ├── index.php
#   │   └── ...
#   └── another-theme/
#       └── ...
#
# Themes in this directory will be vendored into the Docker image
# during build and available in wp-content/themes/
#
# For development mode, this directory is mounted directly into
# the container for hot-reload functionality.
