# Custom WordPress Plugins
#
# Place your custom plugins in this directory.
# Each plugin should be in its own subdirectory or as a single PHP file.
#
# Example structure:
#   plugins/
#   ├── my-plugin/
#   │   ├── my-plugin.php
#   │   └── includes/
#   │       └── ...
#   └── simple-plugin.php
#
# Plugins in this directory will be vendored into the Docker image
# during build and available in wp-content/plugins/
#
# For development mode, this directory is mounted directly into
# the container for hot-reload functionality.
