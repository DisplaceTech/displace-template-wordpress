# Must-Use WordPress Plugins
#
# Place must-use plugins in this directory.
# These plugins are automatically activated and cannot be deactivated
# through the WordPress admin.
#
# Example structure:
#   mu-plugins/
#   ├── security-headers.php
#   └── custom-login.php
#
# Must-use plugins are ideal for:
#   - Security configurations
#   - Custom login modifications
#   - Required functionality that shouldn't be disabled
#
# Note: Subdirectories are NOT automatically loaded in mu-plugins.
# Use a loader file if you need subdirectory support.
